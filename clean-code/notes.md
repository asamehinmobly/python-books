# Ch1. Clean Code
> "Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule (...) It's *your* job to defend the code with equal passion"

- Clean code is *focused*: each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and upolluted, by the surrounding details
- Code, without tests, is not clean. No matter how elegant it is, no matter how readable and accessible, if it hath not tests, it be unclean
- You will read it, and it will be pretty much what you expected. It will be obvious, simple, and compelling

## Reading vs. Writing
- The ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1
- We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code
- **We want the reading of code to be easy, even if it makes the writing harder**
- You cannot write code if you cannot read the surrounding code
- If you want to go fast, get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read
